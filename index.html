		<h2> About </h2>
		<p>WE BMC brings together students in various disciplines and allows them to pursue their interest in biomedical applications. 
		<br> <br> We collaborate with graduate students, professors and industry leaders to show undergraduate students various possibilites in biomedical engineering.  
		<br> <br> The purpose of the BMC is to create awareness for biomedical engineering and to complement the new biomedical concurrent degree introduced in September 2019. Western has a very strong master's program and world-renowned researchers in biomedical engineering. It is now time to bring this to the undergraduate level.</p>
